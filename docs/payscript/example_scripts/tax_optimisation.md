# Tax optimisation
This automation allows you to allocate a percentage of incoming payments to a designated tax account - helping you to  consistently set aside funds for future tax bills and reducing stress during tax season.

Trigger a payment on every incoming transaction. Calculate a specified % amount of tax on the incoming transaction. Automatically transfer the calculated amount to a specified account.
