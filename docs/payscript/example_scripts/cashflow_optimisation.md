# Cash-Flow Optimisation
This automation ensures that funds are always available in the right accounts at the right time - helping corporate customers cover upcoming expenses, avoid overdrafts, and maintain optimal liquidity without manual intervention.

Automatically detect surplus cash above a certain threshold. Transfer surplus into high-interest savings or investment accounts. Trigger cash movement based on account balance thresholds.
