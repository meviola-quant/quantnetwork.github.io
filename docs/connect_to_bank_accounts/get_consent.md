# Step 1: Get Consent for a Bank Account

Providing consent is the essential first step to securely connecting your bank to Quant Flow. This process, often facilitated by Open Banking, is a regulatory requirement that gives you control and security.

## What is Consent?

Consent is your formal authorization for Quant Flow to access specific financial data from your bank, such as transaction histories and account details. This is done through a secure portal directly with your bank, meaning your login credentials are never shared with or seen by Quant Flow.

## How to Get Consent

1.  Navigate to the **Bank Accounts** section in your Quant Flow dashboard.
2.  Click **"Connect New Bank Account"**.
3.  Select your bank from the list of supported institutions.
4.  You will be securely redirected to your own bank's website or app.
5.  Authenticate yourself directly with your bank (e.g., using your mobile banking app, card reader, or password).
6.  Your bank will clearly show what data you are sharing and for how long. Review and confirm this request.

## Consent Expiry (UK Accounts)

For accounts based in the United Kingdom, regulations require that access consents are renewed every **90 days**. Quant Flow will notify your Admin Users well before a consent expires to ensure a seamless, uninterrupted service.
