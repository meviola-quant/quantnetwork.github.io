# Step 2: Link and Activate a Bank Account

After you have successfully granted consent, the next step is to activate the bank account within Quant Flow to start building automations.

## Consent vs. Activation

*   **Consent:** The *permission* to access the data. A company can have consent for many bank accounts.
*   **Linking/Activation:** The *action* of using that consented account within your automations. The number of accounts you can activate is limited by your User Plan.

## How to Link an Account

1.  Go to **Bank Accounts**. You will see a list of all accounts for which your company has given consent. They are going to be separated in two sections **"Active bank account"s, "Inactive bank accounts"**
2.  Find the account you wish to use in the **"Inactive bank accounts"** and click **"Activate"**.
3.  The system will check if you have available slots in your current User Plan.
4.  If you do, the account will become active and its status will change to **"Active"**. You can now create automations that use this account.
5.  If you have reached your plan's limit, you will be prompted to **upgrade your plan** before you can activate the new account.
