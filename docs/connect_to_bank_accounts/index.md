# Connect Your Bank Accounts to Quant Flow

Welcome to the heart of your financial automation. Connecting your bank accounts is a secure and straightforward process that unlocks the full power of Quant Flow for your company.

Once connected, you can automate payments, reconcile transactions, and gain real-time financial insightsâ€”all from a single dashboard.

## How It Works: A Simple Three-Step Process

Linking a new bank account to your company's Quant Flow profile is designed to be quick and compliant.

1.  **Grant Consent (Authorize)**
    *   **What it is:** You securely provide Quant Flow with permission to access transaction data from your bank. This is a standard regulatory requirement known as Open Banking (in the UK/Europe) or similar frameworks globally.
    *   **Who does it:** Any Admin User for your company. The authorization is given for the entire company, not just an individual user.

2.  **Link & Activate**
    *   **What it is:** Once consent is granted, you "activate" the bank account for use within Quant Flow. This is when the magic starts.
    *   **Who does it:** An Admin User decides which consented accounts to activate.
    *   **The Key:** The number of bank accounts you can actively **link and use** is determined by your **Quant Flow User Plan**. Think of your plan as defining how many simultaneous automation streams you can have.

3.  **Manage & Automate**
    *   **What it is:** With an active bank account linked, you can now create powerful automations (like rule-based payments, cash flow forecasts, and reconciliation scripts) that run seamlessly.
    *   **You are in control:** You can view connection status, extend consents, or deactivate accounts at any time from your dashboard.

## Key Things to Know

*   **Company-Wide Access:** All Admin Users under your `CompanyID` can view and manage your company's bank connections. This ensures transparency and collaborative financial management.
*   **Your Plan, Your Capacity:** Your subscription plan defines the number of bank accounts you can have **active and automated** at once. You can always upgrade your plan to link more accounts.
*   **Secure by Design:** We use robust, bank-level security and never store your online banking credentials.
