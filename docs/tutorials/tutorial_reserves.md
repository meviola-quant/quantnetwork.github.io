# Reserves
Reserves are an abstract segregation of funds that can be used to help manage an account's funds. Funds that are moved to a reserve are still in that acconut, and count toward its total balance, however they won't count towards their available balance and won't be able to be used until it is moved out of the reserve.

Reserves also keep a history of the transactions made to and from them.
