# Personas
The white label version of Quant Flow is designed for financial service providers such as banks. With that in mind, the following personas are referred to in this documentation as a generalisation of roles played in the product vision.

## Bank
The financial service provider which has adopted and implemented Quant Flow.

## Developer
The professional responsible for developing and managing PayScripts.

## Customer
The Bank's end user, utilising the provided financial services powered by Quant Flow. In the Sandbox, customers do this by creating [Automations], while in a real implementation of Quant Flow the features can be made available in different ways.
