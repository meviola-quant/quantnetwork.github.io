## Quant Flow
Quant flow is a suite of products that enables payment programmability for Financial Service Providers (FSPs). It is meant to be easily installed into existing core banking systems to quickly enable programmability-powered features to your customers.


## Payscript
[Payscript] is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) focused on the financial services domain. It implements functions such as transfers, checks, and scheduling, while inherently respecting regulatory constraints.

The language is built atop [Groovy], being syntax-compatible with both it and Java, which eases its adoption by development teams.

## Sandbox
The [Payscript Sandbox][sandbox] is a test environment that offers the possibility of seeing Quant Flowâ€™s features in action, both while prospecting whether Quant Flow fits your use case, or during the early stages of adoption to help development. Once you are granted access, the sandbox will show you what Quant Flow might look like in action, and be able to freely manage the test data, implement functionality and see it in action.
